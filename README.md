# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

Airports around the world handle several thousands of bags every day. Even in most modernized airports, bags are expected to be handled manually at some points and so there are chances for missed bags, misplaced bags, and delays in loading or delivery.

This project aims at developing a web-based application to resolve some of the issues, if not all, mentioned above. For simplicity, we consider only one airport and only departure activities.
